### 1.[What Is Code Quality? Overview + How to Improve Code Quality](https://www.perforce.com/blog/sca/what-code-quality-overview-how-improve-code-quality)

This article delves into code quality metrics, exploring the subjective nature of what constitutes good and bad code. It highlights the significance of code quality and its far-reaching impact on software reliability and security, particularly in safety-critical systems.

Code quality encompasses factors like cleanliness, longevity, consistency, functionality, clarity, and documentation.Even rigorous testing and manual code reviews may fall short in uncovering all code errors, as studies suggest low efficiency rates in these processes.

Low-quality code harbors potential risks, especially when it comes to safety or security breaches, potentially resulting in catastrophic outcomes.
Achieving high-quality code is a shared responsibility among developers, testers, and managers throughout the development cycle.

Measuring code quality requires a nuanced approach, considering aspects such as reliability, maintainability, testability, portability, and reusability. Metrics like defect count, severity, cyclomatic complexity, and Halstead complexity are crucial for assessing code quality. Improving code quality involves using coding standards, analyzing code early, following best practices in code reviews, and selectively refactoring legacy code. Early quality analysis can lower long-term maintenance costs and reduce technical debt.

Selecting the right code quality tools, such as static analyzers like Helix QAC and Klocwork, can facilitate adherence to coding standards and overall quality improvement.
