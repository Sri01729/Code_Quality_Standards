### 1.[What Is Code Quality? Overview + How to Improve Code Quality](https://www.perforce.com/blog/sca/what-code-quality-overview-how-improve-code-quality)

This article delves into code quality metrics, exploring the subjective nature of what constitutes good and bad code. It highlights the significance of code quality and its far-reaching impact on software reliability and security, particularly in safety-critical systems.

Code quality encompasses factors like cleanliness, longevity, consistency, functionality, clarity, and documentation.Even rigorous testing and manual code reviews may fall short in uncovering all code errors, as studies suggest low efficiency rates in these processes.

Low-quality code harbors potential risks, especially when it comes to safety or security breaches, potentially resulting in catastrophic outcomes.
Achieving high-quality code is a shared responsibility among developers, testers, and managers throughout the development cycle.

Measuring code quality requires a nuanced approach, considering aspects such as reliability, maintainability, testability, portability, and reusability. Metrics like defect count, severity, cyclomatic complexity, and Halstead complexity are crucial for assessing code quality. Improving code quality involves using coding standards, analyzing code early, following best practices in code reviews, and selectively refactoring legacy code. Early quality analysis can lower long-term maintenance costs and reduce technical debt.

Selecting the right code quality tools, such as static analyzers like Helix QAC and Klocwork, can facilitate adherence to coding standards and overall quality improvement.

#### Checklist

- [x] Understand that code quality is a subjective concept, varying between teams and contexts.
 Recognize that high-quality code is essential for software reliability, security, and safety, especially in critical systems.
 - [x] Good code is clean, stands the test of time, and does what it's supposed to.
 - [x] Good code follows a consistent style, making it easy to read and understand.
 - [x] Ensure good code is well-documented and can be tested effectively.
 - [x] Acknowledge that manual code reviews and testing are essential but may not catch all errors.
 - [x] Understand that individual programmers may be less than 50% efficient at finding bugs in their own software, and most testing methods are only 35% efficient.
 - [x] Recognize that low-quality code introduces safety and security risks.
 - [x] Understand the potential catastrophic consequences of software failure due to code quality issues.
 - [x] Embrace the idea that achieving high code quality is a shared responsibility involving developers, testers, and managers.
 - [x] Acknowledge that there is no one-size-fits-all method for measuring code quality.
 - [x] Understand that key code quality aspects include reliability, maintainability, testability, portability, and reusability.
 - [x] Consider metrics such as defect counts, defect severity, cyclomatic complexity, and Halstead complexity for assessing code quality.
 - [x] Use a coding standard to ensure code consistency and readability.
 - [x] Analyze code before code reviews to catch quality issues early.
 - [x] Follow code review best practices for improved software quality.
 - [x] When necessary, refactor legacy code to reduce complexity and improve quality.
 - [x] Recognize the importance of early code quality analysis.
 - [x] Understand that introducing quality early can reduce long-term maintenance costs and technical debt.
 - [x] Consider using code quality tools like static analyzers (e.g., Helix QAC and Klocwork) to enforce coding standards and monitor quality metrics.
