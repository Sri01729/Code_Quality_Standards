## Articles
### 1. [What Is Code Quality? Overview + How to Improve Code Quality](https://www.perforce.com/blog/sca/what-code-quality-overview-how-improve-code-quality)

This article delves into code quality metrics, exploring the subjective nature of what constitutes good and bad code. It highlights the significance of code quality and its far-reaching impact on software reliability and security, particularly in safety-critical systems.

Code quality encompasses factors like cleanliness, longevity, consistency, functionality, clarity, and documentation.Even rigorous testing and manual code reviews may fall short in uncovering all code errors, as studies suggest low efficiency rates in these processes.

Low-quality code harbors potential risks, especially when it comes to safety or security breaches, potentially resulting in catastrophic outcomes.
Achieving high-quality code is a shared responsibility among developers, testers, and managers throughout the development cycle.

Measuring code quality requires a nuanced approach, considering aspects such as reliability, maintainability, testability, portability, and reusability. Metrics like defect count, severity, cyclomatic complexity, and Halstead complexity are crucial for assessing code quality. Improving code quality involves using coding standards, analyzing code early, following best practices in code reviews, and selectively refactoring legacy code. Early quality analysis can lower long-term maintenance costs and reduce technical debt.

Selecting the right code quality tools, such as static analyzers like Helix QAC and Klocwork, can facilitate adherence to coding standards and overall quality improvement.

 #### Checklist Summary

 ##### 1. Code should be easy to read

 - [x] Use meaningful variable and function names.
- [x]  Follow proper indentation and formatting for readability.
Example:

Bad Practice:

``` php
function x($a){$b=0;for($i=0;$i<count($a);$i++){$b+=$a[$i];}return $b;}
```
Good Practice:

``` php
function sumArray($numbers) {
    $total = 0;
    for ($i = 0; $i < count($numbers); $i++) {
        $total += $numbers[$i];
    }
    return $total;
}
```
##### 2. Code should be DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

 - [x] Avoid redundant code by refactoring it into reusable functions or classes.
Example:

Bad Practice:

``` php
function getFullName($firstName, $lastName) {
    echo $firstName . ' ' . $lastName;
}
```
``` php
function getUserName($firstName, $lastName) {
    echo substr($firstName, 0, 1) . $lastName;
}
```
Good Practice:

``` php
function getFullName($firstName, $lastName) {
    return $firstName . ' ' . $lastName;
}
```
``` php
function getUserName($firstName, $lastName) {
    return substr($firstName, 0, 1) . $lastName;
}
```
##### 3. Code should be modular

 - [x] Break code into smaller, reusable modules or functions with a single responsibility.
Example:

Bad Practice:

``` php
function userRegistration($firstName, $lastName, $email, $password) {
    // ...
}
```
Good Practice:

``` php
function validateInput($firstName, $lastName, $email, $password) {
    // ...
}
```
``` php
function createUser($firstName, $lastName, $email, $password) {
    // ...
}
```
``` php
function sendWelcomeEmail($email) {
    // ...
}
```
``` php
function userRegistration($firstName, $lastName, $email, $password) {
    // ...
}
```
##### 4. Code should be efficient

 - [x] Consider performance and resource utilization when writing code.
Example:

Bad Practice:

``` php

function findElement($array, $element) {
    for ($i = 0; $i < count($array); $i++) {
        if ($array[$i] === $element) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
Good Practice:

``` php

function findElement($array, $element) {
    return in_array($element, $array);
}
```
##### 5. Code should be robust and handle errors gracefully

 - [x] Validate inputs and handle exceptions properly to prevent crashes or unpredictable behavior.
Example:

Bad Practice:

``` php

function divide($num1, $num2) {
    return $num1 / $num2;
}
```
Good Practice:

``` php

function divide($num1, $num2) {
    if ($num2 == 0) {
        throw new InvalidArgumentException("Cannot divide by zero.");
    }
    return $num1 / $num2;
}
```
##### 6. Code should be testable

 - [x] Design code to be easily testable using unit tests, with clear inputs and outputs.
Example:

Bad Practice:

``` php

class Order {
    // ...
}
```
Good Practice:

``` php

class Order {
    // ...
}
```
##### 7. Code should follow a coding standard

 - [x] Adhere to a coding standard or style guide to maintain consistency and readability.
Example:

Bad Practice:

``` php
class myClass {
    // ...
}
```
Good Practice:

``` php

class MyClass {
    // ...
}
```
##### 8. Code should be well-documented

 - [x] Use comments and PHPDoc blocks to explain complex logic and provide structured documentation.
Example:

Bad Practice:

``` php
// Adds 1 to the number
function addOne($num) {
    return $num + 1;
}
```
Good Practice:

``` php

/**
 * Increments the given number by one.
 *
 * @param int $num The number to increment.
 * @return int The incremented number.
 */
function increment($num) {
    return $num + 1;
}
```
This checklist summarizes the key principles and examples for writing clean code in PHP, promoting readability, maintainability, and code quality.
